## Usage
See the [Argos README](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos/blob/master/README.md) for general information about how Argos works.

- Clone this repo wherever you like
- Make a symlink to `jiraManager.py` in `~/.config/argos`
- Create `.jira_credentials.json` and `.jira_reviewers.json` wherever you cloned this repo:
### .jira_credentials.json
This file contains your credentials to log into JIRA.
```
{
    "host": "https://<YOUR_JIRA>.atlassian.net",
    "username": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
    "password": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
}
```
- Create an API key [here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens).
### .jira_reviewers.json
This file contains the **usernames** of users to display under "reassign for review".
```
["<USERNAME_1>", "<USERNAME_2>", ...]
```
Find usernames with `./jiraManager.py users`
